# Contributing to RailPulse

Thank you for your interest in contributing to RailPulse! We welcome contributions of all kinds — code, documentation, tests, bug reports, feature requests, and improvements to these guidelines.

## Code of conduct
Please follow the project's Code of Conduct (if present). Be respectful, constructive, and patient when interacting with maintainers and other contributors.

## How to file an issue
- Search existing issues and pull requests to check whether the problem or idea already exists.
- Open a new issue and include:
  - A clear and descriptive title
  - A concise description of the problem or proposed change
  - Steps to reproduce (for bugs) and expected vs. actual behavior
  - Environment details (OS, Python/Node/Go version, etc.) if relevant
  - Logs or screenshots when helpful

## How to contribute code (pull requests)
1. Fork the repository and clone your fork.
2. Create a new branch with a descriptive name (e.g., `fix/auth-timeout`, `feat/add-telemetry`, or `docs/update-readme`).
3. Make your changes in the new branch. Keep commits small and focused.
4. Update or add tests for any new behavior.
5. Run the test suite and linters locally before submitting.
6. Rebase or merge from the repository's default branch to keep your branch up to date.
7. Open a pull request against the repository's default branch. In the PR description, explain the change, why it is needed, and any trade-offs.

### Commit messages
Use clear, imperative commit messages. Examples:
- "Fix: handle nil pointer in connection manager"
- "Feat: add configurable sampling rate for telemetry"
- "Docs: update contributing guide"

## Code style and tests
- Follow existing project coding conventions. Use the same style and formatting as surrounding code.
- Add unit tests for new features and bug fixes where appropriate.
- Ensure all tests pass locally and in CI.

## Review process
- Maintainters will review PRs and may request changes. Please respond constructively to review comments.
- Small or documentation-only changes may be merged by maintainers without extensive review.

## Small contributions
If you’re not ready to submit code, you can still help by:
- Reporting bugs and including reproduction steps
- Improving documentation and examples
- Writing or improving tests

## Questions
If you're unsure where to start, open an issue labelled "help wanted" or "good first issue" (if available), or ask maintainers for guidance.

Thank you for helping make RailPulse better!
